      description: Use the Signal REST API to send signals to all participants in an active Vonage Video session or to a specific client connected to that session. Signals sent from the server have an empty from parameter in the signal received handlers on clients connected to the session. For a signal sent from a participant in the session, the from property is set the connection ID of the client that sent the signal, but in this case there is no associated connection.

      summary: Stop an archive
      description: |
        To stop recording an archive, submit an HTTP POST request.

        Archives stop recording after 4 hours (14,400 seconds), or 60 seconds after the last client disconnects from the session, or 60 minutes after the last client stops publishing. However, automatic archives continue recording to multiple consecutive files of up to 4 hours in length each. For more information, see Archive duration

        Calling this method for automatic archives has no effect. Automatic archives continue recording to multiple consecutive files of up to 4 hours (14,400 seconds) in length each, until 60 seconds after the last client disconnects from the session, or 60 minutes after the last client stops publishing a stream to the session.

            * "paused" — When an archive is paused, nothing is recorded. The archive is paused if any of the following conditions occur:
                * No clients are publishing streams to the session. In this case, there is a timeout of 60 minutes, after which the archive stops and the archive status changes to "stopped".
                * All clients disconnect the session. After 60 seconds the archive stops and the archive status changes to "stopped".
                
                If a client resumes publishing while the archive is in the "paused" state, the archive recording resumes and the status changes back to "started".
            * "started" — The archive started and is in the process of being recorded.
            * "stopped" — The archive stopped recording.
